# Software Architectural Patterns

## **Command-Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) Pattern**

**CQRS** is a pattern that separates the handling of commands (which change the state of the system) from the handling of queries (which retrieve information from the system). This allows for a more flexible and scalable architecture, as the read and write models can be optimized independently.

* **Examples and Use Cases:**
    * **Complex Business Logic:** In applications where the reading and writing workloads are very different, like an e-commerce system with a high volume of product views but fewer order creations.
    * **Event-Sourced Systems:** CQRS is often used in conjunction with Event Sourcing, where commands are saved as events and queries read from a separate, denormalized read model.

* **Best for:**
    * **Scalability:** The read model can be scaled independently of the write model.
    * **Performance:** Queries can be optimized for speed, as they don't need to handle writes.
    * **Flexibility:** Allows for different data stores for the read and write models (e.g., a NoSQL database for reads and a SQL database for writes).

* **Challenges:**
    * **Complexity:** Significantly increases the complexity of the system due to the separation of responsibilities.
    * **Eventual Consistency:** The read model may not be instantly consistent with the write model.
    * **Data Synchronization:** Managing the synchronization between the write and read models requires careful design.

## **Event Sourcing Pattern**

**Event Sourcing** is a pattern that stores all changes to the system's state as a sequence of events, rather than just storing the current state. The current state is then rebuilt by replaying the stream of events.

* **Examples and Use Cases:**
    * **Financial Systems:** A banking application can use Event Sourcing to store all transactions (events) in an immutable log. The account balance is then calculated from these events.
    * **Auditing and Logging:** Provides a perfect audit trail of all changes to the system.
    * **Collaboration Tools:** A document editor that needs to track every change made by different users.

* **Best for:**
    * **Auditing and Debugging:** The event log provides a complete history, which makes debugging and auditing much easier.
    * **Data Integrity:** Because the events are immutable, data integrity is guaranteed.
    * **Temporal Queries:** Allows for "time-travel" functionality to see the state of the system at any point in time.

* **Challenges:**
    * **Complexity:** Requires a fundamental change in how the application is designed.
    * **Querying:** Retrieving information from the event log can be slow if it is not combined with another pattern like CQRS.
    * **Data Storage:** The size of the event log can grow very large over time.

## **Pipe-and-Filter Pattern**

The **Pipe-and-Filter** pattern is used for building systems that process a stream of data in a sequential manner. Each processing step is encapsulated in a **Filter**, and the data is passed from one filter to the next via a **Pipe**.

* **Examples and Use Cases:**
    * **Data Processing Pipelines:** An ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) system that extracts data, transforms it (cleans, aggregates), and loads it into a data warehouse.
    * **Compiler Design:** A compiler pipeline where the source code is passed through a tokenizer, a parser, a code generator, etc.

* **Best for:**
    * **Simplicity and Reusability:** Each filter can be designed independently and reused in different pipelines.
    * **Parallelism:** Filters can be run in parallel, which improves performance.
    * **Modularity:** The system is easy to maintain and understand because each filter has a single responsibility.

* **Challenges:**
    * **Performance:** The overhead of passing data between filters can introduce latency.
    * **Data Format:** The data format must be consistent between all filters.
    * **Error Handling:** Handling errors within the pipeline can be challenging.
