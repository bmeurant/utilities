                "question": "Your company is setting up a new Google Cloud project for a highly sensitive application. You need to ensure that all resources deployed within this project automatically enforce data residency requirements by only allowing deployment in the europe-west1 region. Which of the following is the most effective and scalable way to enforce this policy?",
                "answerOptions": [
                    {"text": "A. Apply an IAM condition to all users, denying resource creation outside europe-west1.", "isCorrect": false, "rationale": "IAM conditions are used to grant access based on conditions (like region) but are not the primary mechanism for enforcing resource-level policies across an entire project or organization. They can be complex to manage for all users and services."},
                    {"text": "B. Configure a custom startup script on all Compute Engine instances to check their region.", "isCorrect": false, "rationale": "This approach is not scalable and is limited to Compute Engine. It's reactive rather than proactive, meaning a resource could be created outside the allowed region before the script runs, and it doesn't prevent other services (like Cloud Storage or Cloud SQL) from being deployed elsewhere."},
                    {"text": "C. Create an Organization Policy with the constraints/gcp.resourceLocations constraint applied to the project.", "isCorrect": true, "rationale": "Organization Policies are the correct and most effective way to enforce constraints on Google Cloud resources at the project, folder, or organization level. The `constraints/gcp.resourceLocations` constraint specifically controls the locations where resources can be created, making this the ideal solution for data residency requirements."},
                    {"text": "D. Set the default region for the project in the project settings.", "isCorrect": false, "rationale": "Setting a default region is a convenience feature, not a hard enforcement mechanism. Users can still explicitly specify a different region during resource creation, bypassing this setting."}

                "question": "Your security team requires that all new Compute Engine instances must have a specific set of security tags applied automatically upon creation. These tags are critical for firewall rules and auditing. How can you ensure this requirement is met for all instances launched in a specific project?",
                "answerOptions": [
                    {"text": "A. Include the tags in the instance template used by a Managed Instance Group.", "isCorrect": false, "rationale": "This only applies to instances created by a Managed Instance Group using that specific template. It does not enforce the policy for instances created individually or through other means."},
                    {"text": "B. Create a custom IAM role that mandates tags for instance creation.", "isCorrect": false, "rationale": "IAM roles control permissions (what a user can do), not resource configurations (how a resource is created). There is no IAM permission or condition that forces a tag to be included during instance creation."},
                    {"text": "C. Develop a Cloud Function triggered by instance creation to apply the tags.", "isCorrect": false, "rationale": "This is a reactive solution. The instance would be created first without the tag, and the Cloud Function would then need to be triggered to add it. This introduces a small window of non-compliance and adds complexity. The goal is to prevent creation without the tag in the first place."},
                    {"text": "D. Use an Organization Policy to enforce required instance tags.", "isCorrect": true, "rationale": "Organization Policies are the correct mechanism for enforcing specific configurations or constraints across a project or folder, including requiring specific tags on resources like Compute Engine instances. The `constraints/compute.requireInstanceTags` constraint is designed for this exact purpose, providing a proactive and centralized enforcement."}

                    {"text": "B. Folders", "isCorrect": true, "rationale": "Folders are the correct component for this scenario. They allow you to group projects and apply IAM policies and Organization Policies at the folder level, which are then inherited by all projects within that folder. This provides a clean, hierarchical structure for departmental organization."},
